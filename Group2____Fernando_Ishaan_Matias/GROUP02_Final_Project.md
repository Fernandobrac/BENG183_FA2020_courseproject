## Introduction

With the invention of new OMIC technologies, as well as with the advancement in technology withing new and old OMIC technologies, such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing, biological data has increased exponentially. These datasets are complex and would be nearly impossible for a human to extract valuable information from these in order to interpret it and make conclusions about it. Thus, this has given bioinformaticians and machine learning researchers a challenge to come up with ways to extract valuable information from these biological datasets to be able to fully analyze them. This has given rise to different deep learning algorithms and methods which are able to identify complex patterns and create predictive models and from these large biological datasets (1). 

This paper will explain the background of OMICS and Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, applications of CNNs in OMICS data analysis will be explored in more detail.
